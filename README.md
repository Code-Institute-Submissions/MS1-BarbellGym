<h3>Design</h3>

* Colour scheme - Main colours of the site are black and white, inkeeping with the brand logo and colour scheme.

* Typography - Big shoulders stencil text has been used for titles as it is eye-catching and brings a different
dimension to a black & white site. Roboto has been used for paragraphs and content as it is a clear font. back-up is
Sans-serif, should either of the other fonts fail to load.

* Imagery - The logo/hero image is used to promote brand awareness. It is permanently fixed in the middle of the header
to draw the attention of the user back to the brand as they navigate through the site. We've also incorporated images
of the gym and classes as well as the business owner to support user stories 1 - 11. All images uploaded are donated
by the Barbell Gym business, with exception of the background image for the header which is from freepik.com
(see credits/references).

* Changes from design: <br>
There were 2 changes from the original designs provided in the wireframes:<br>
1. The nav bar in mobile view is in a grid view and in 2 separate rows in mobile view instead of one
row. This was done so the navigation CTA could remain clear and was a more aesthetically pleasing design.
2. The barbell gear products were displayed in their own row, rather than side by side as shown in the
wireframes. This is because there are 4 product groups total and no shop functionality as of yet, therefore
it seemed more appropriate to make more space for images and information about the products rather than  give
it a typical shop layout.
