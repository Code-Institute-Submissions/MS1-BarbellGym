<h1>The Barbell Gym</h1>

This is my submission for Milestone project 1. The Barbell Gym is the main site for the Barbell Gym business,
an independently owned gym providing various strength and fitness classes and a line of merchandise. The purpose 
of this site is to increase brand awareness, advertise the services and products available and how and where to 
get in touch with the gym.

Design:

Colour scheme - Main colours of the site are black and white, inkeeping with the brand logo and colour scheme.

Typography - Big shoulders stencil text has been used for titles as it is eye-catching and brings a different
dimension to a black & white site. Roboto has been used for paragraphs and content as it is a clear font. back-up is
Sans-serif, should either of the other fonts fail to load.

Imagery - The logo/hero image is used to promote brand awareness. It is permanently fixed in the middle of the header
to draw the attention of the user back to the brand as they navigate through the site. We've also incorporated images
of the gym and classes as well as the business owner to support user stories 1 - 11. All images uploaded are donated
by the Barbell Gym business, with exception of the background image for the header which is from freepik.com
(see credits/references).
